# Build Guide

1. To build the game you need Visual Sudio 2022, get it here:
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/

2. Once installed, check `build.bat` and make sure the path:
call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"`

3. If it's not corret, then update the path to match your system!

4. Call `build.bat` and the program should build.
